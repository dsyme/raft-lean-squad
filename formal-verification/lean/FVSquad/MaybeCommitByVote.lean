# MaybeCommitByVote — Lean 4 Specification, Implementation, and Proofs

Models `RaftCore::maybe_commit_by_vote` in `src/raft.rs` (lines ≈ 2219–2250):
a TiKV-specific fast-forward optimisation that advances a follower/candidate's
commit index upon receipt of a vote-rejection message.

## Relevant Rust code

```rust
fn maybe_commit_by_vote(&mut self, m: &Message) {
    if m.commit == 0 || m.commit_term == 0 {
        return;
    }
    let last_commit = self.raft_log.committed;
    if m.commit <= last_commit || self.state == StateRole::Leader {
        return;
    }
    if !self.raft_log.maybe_commit(m.commit, m.commit_term) {
        return;
    }
    // ... logging (omitted) ...
    if self.state != StateRole::Candidate && self.state != StateRole::PreCandidate {
        return;
    }
    let low  = last_commit + 1;
    let high = self.raft_log.committed + 1;
    let ctx  = GetEntriesContext(GetEntriesFor::CommitByVote);
    if self.has_unapplied_conf_changes(low, high, ctx) {
        let term = self.term;
        self.become_follower(term, INVALID_ID);
    }
}
```

## Model scope and approximations

* **`maybe_commit`** is abstracted as a Boolean predicate `canAdvance`:
  `canAdvance(log, commit_idx, commit_term)` holds when the local log has an
  entry at `commit_idx` with term `commit_term` AND `commit_idx > committed`.
  We do not model the log internals; only the Boolean outcome matters here.
* **`has_unapplied_conf_changes`** is abstracted as a Boolean parameter
  `hasConfChange : Bool` provided to the model.
* **`become_follower`** is modelled as setting `state := Follower`.
  We do NOT model the leader-id or heartbeat-elapsed fields it also sets.
* **Term** is modelled as a `Nat`; we verify it is unchanged by this function.
* **StateRole** has four values: Leader, Follower, Candidate, PreCandidate.
* I/O, logging, inflight windows, and progress tracking are omitted.

/-! ## Types -/

/-- Raft node state roles. -/
inductive StateRole where
  | Leader
  | Follower
  | Candidate
  | PreCandidate
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Minimal Raft node state for this model. -/
structure RaftState where
  /-- Current term. -/
  term      : Nat
  /-- Node's current role. -/
  state     : StateRole
  /-- Current commit index. -/
  committed : Nat
  deriving Repr

/-- Incoming vote-response message fields relevant to `maybe_commit_by_vote`. -/
structure VoteMsg where
  /-- Voter's committed index (0 = not provided). -/
  commit      : Nat
  /-- Term of the entry at `commit` (0 = not provided). -/
  commit_term : Nat
  deriving Repr

/-! ## Implementation model -/

/-- `maybe_commit_by_vote` result.
    We separate the outcome from the abstract parameters to keep the model clean. -/
structure McbvResult where
  /-- Updated committed index. -/
  committed : Nat
  /-- Updated state. -/
  state     : StateRole
  /-- Updated term (should be unchanged). -/
  term      : Nat
  deriving Repr

/-- Pure model of `maybe_commit_by_vote`.
    Parameters:
    - `s`: node state before the call
    - `m`: the incoming vote-response message
    - `canAdvance`: abstract result of `raft_log.maybe_commit(m.commit, m.commit_term)`.
      Precondition: `canAdvance → m.commit > s.committed` (the log check subsumes this).
    - `hasConfChange`: abstract result of `has_unapplied_conf_changes(low, high, ctx)`.
