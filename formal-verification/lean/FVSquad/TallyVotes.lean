# TallyVotes and HasQuorum — Lean 4 Specification

Formal specification of `ProgressTracker::tally_votes` and `ProgressTracker::has_quorum`
from `raft-rs` (`src/tracker.rs`).

## Model scope and approximations

* **Types**: Voter IDs are `Nat` (Rust: `u64`; overflow irrelevant for these algebraic
  properties).
* **`voters`**: modelled as a `Finset Nat` (no duplicate IDs; hash-map details irrelevant).
* **`votes`**: modelled as a total function `Nat → Option Bool` (Rust: `HashMap<u64, bool>`;
  keys absent from the map are `None`).
* **Joint quorum (two-phase config)**: *not* modelled here — we model the single-phase
  majority case (`outgoing = ∅`). Joint-quorum safety is verified in `JointQuorum.lean`.
* **Omitted**: concurrency, I/O, error handling, memory layout, `AckedIndexer` trait.

The `grantedCount`/`rejectedCount` definitions reuse the `yesCount`/`voteResult`
infrastructure from `MajorityQuorum.lean`.

🔬 *Lean Squad — auto-generated formal specification.*
