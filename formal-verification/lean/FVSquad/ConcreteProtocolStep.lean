# ConcreteProtocolStep — Valid AE Step Gives RaftReachable (A5 Bridge)

> 🔬 *Lean Squad — automated formal verification for `dsyme/raft-lean-squad`.*

This file provides the **A5 bridge**: given a single, valid AppendEntries step with
concrete protocol conditions, the resulting cluster state is `RaftReachable`.

## Background

`RaftTrace.lean` defines `RaftReachable` inductively.  The `step` constructor requires
five hypotheses for each protocol transition:
- `hlogs'`: only voter `v`'s log changes
- `hno_overwrite`: old committed entries of voter `v` are not overwritten
- `hqc_preserved`: quorum-certified entries are preserved in ALL voters' logs
- `hcommitted_mono`: committed indices only advance
- `hnew_cert`: newly committed entries are quorum-certified in the new state

This file defines `ValidAEStep` — a structure encapsulating the concrete protocol
conditions for a single AppendEntries step — and proves that it satisfies all five
`RaftReachable.step` hypotheses.  This converts the abstract inductive step into a
concrete protocol rule: a well-formed AE step on a reachable state produces a new
reachable state.

## Key Definitions

1. **`ValidAEStep`** — bundles the concrete AE conditions:
   - `hlogs'_other`: only voter `v`'s log is updated
   - `hlogs'_v`: voter `v`'s log is exactly `applyAppendEntries` of the message
   - `hprev`: prev-entry match (leader and voter agree at `prevLogIndex`)
   - `hcand_eq`: new entries beyond `prevLogIndex` match the leader's log
   - `h_committed_le_prev`: voter's committed ≤ `prevLogIndex` (no rollback)
   - `hcommitted_mono`: committed indices only advance
   - `hnew_cert`: newly committed entries are quorum-certified
   - `hqc_preserved`: quorum-certified entries remain quorum-certified (weak form)

2. **`CPS1`** (`validAEStep_hno_overwrite`) — the committed-entries invariant:
   voter `v`'s committed entries are not overwritten (from `h_committed_le_prev` + CT2).

3. **`CPS2`** (`validAEStep_raftReachable`) — **the main theorem**:
   a valid AE step on a `RaftReachable` state gives a new `RaftReachable` state.

4. **`CPS3`** (`validAEStep_hcand_eq_at_entry`) — entry-level correctness:
   new entries in the AE message appear correctly at their target indices.

5. **`CPS4`** (`validAEStep_prefix_unchanged`) — prefix preservation:
   indices ≤ `prevLogIndex` in voter `v`'s log are unchanged by the step.

6. **`CPS5`** (`validAEStep_lmi_preserved`) — log-matching invariant:
   a valid AE step preserves `LogMatchingInvariantFor` (using CT4).

7. **`CPS6`** (`validAEStep_hlc`) — leader completeness:
   if `CandLogMatching` holds before the step, `HLogConsistency` follows after
   (using CT5b/`hlc_from_hae`).

8. **`CPS7`** (`validAEStep_new_entry_at`) — the new entry at a given index:
   after the step, voter `v`'s log at `prevLogIndex + 1 + j` = the entry from `msg`.

9. **`CPS8`** (`validAEStep_logs_v`) — voter `v`'s log is the updated log.

10. **`CPS9`** (`validAEStep_logs_other`) — other voters' logs are unchanged.

11. **`CPS10`** (`twoStep_raftReachable`) — two consecutive valid AE steps:
    if two steps are valid sequentially, the result is `RaftReachable`.

12. **`CPS11`** (`validAEStep_committed_invariant`) — committed invariant:
    committed indices of non-`v` voters are unchanged in the step.

13. **`CPS12`** (`ae_step_no_rollback`) — no committed-entry rollback in entire cluster:
    for all voters, committed entries are not overwritten by the step.

14. **`CPS13`** (`validAEStep_hqc_preserved_from_lc`) — **discharge `hqc_preserved` from LC**:
    given `CandidateLogCovers` (leader completeness), the `hqc_preserved` condition of
    `ValidAEStep` follows from the AE step structure.  This is the key theorem connecting
    leader completeness to the `RaftReachable` reachability model.

## Relationship to the A5 Gap

`RaftReachable.step` bundles five abstract hypotheses.  This file shows they are
satisfied by a concrete AE step when:

| `step` hypothesis  | Comes from (`ValidAEStep` field)                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hlogs'`           | `hlogs'_other`: other voters' logs unchanged                    |
| `hno_overwrite`    | `h_committed_le_prev` + CT2 (`applyAE_preserves_prefix`)       |
| `hqc_preserved`    | CPS13: from `CandidateLogCovers` + `hcand_eq` + `hlogs'_other` |
| `hcommitted_mono`  | `hcommitted_mono`: explicit hypothesis                          |
| `hnew_cert`        | `hnew_cert`: explicit hypothesis (CommitRuleValid / CR8)        |

**CPS13 closes `hqc_preserved`**: given that the leader has all quorum-certified entries
(`CandidateLogCovers`, from `LeaderCompleteness.lean`) and the AE step only updates voter
`v`'s log with entries from the leader's log, the quorum-certification of any previously
committed entry is preserved — either because the voter's log was unchanged (other voters
and indices below `prevLogIndex`) or because voter `v` now has the leader's entry (indices
above `prevLogIndex`).

The remaining two explicit hypotheses (`hcommitted_mono`, `hnew_cert`) still need to be
discharged from a concrete term-and-election model.
`CommitRule.lean` (CR8) discharges `hnew_cert` when `CommitRuleValid` holds.

/-! ## ValidAEStep structure -/

/-- **ValidAEStep** — the concrete conditions for a valid single AppendEntries step.

    A step is parameterised by:
    - `cs`: the old cluster state
    - `cs'`: the new cluster state
    - `lead`: the leader node (sender of the AE message)
    - `v`: the follower node (receiver, whose log is updated)
    - `msg`: the AppendEntries message

    The fields capture the Raft protocol invariants that make a single AE step safe.
    Together with `RaftReachable cs`, they are exactly what is needed to conclude
    `RaftReachable cs'` (see `validAEStep_raftReachable`, CPS2). -/
structure ValidAEStep (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] (cs : ClusterState E) (lead v : Nat)
    (msg : AppendEntriesMsg E) (cs' : ClusterState E) : Prop where
  /-- The voter list is unchanged. -/
  hvoters : cs'.voters = cs.voters
  /-- Only voter `v`'s log changes; all other voters' logs are unchanged. -/
  hlogs'_other : ∀ w, w ≠ v → cs'.logs w = cs.logs w
  /-- Voter `v`'s new log is exactly `applyAppendEntries` of the message. -/
  hlogs'_v : cs'.logs v = applyAppendEntries E (cs.logs v) msg
  /-- Prev-entry match: leader's log agrees with voter `v` at `prevLogIndex`.
      This is the Raft AppendEntries precondition (§5.3): a follower only applies
      an AE message if its log matches the leader's at `prevLogIndex`. -/
  hprev : cs.logs lead msg.prevLogIndex = cs.logs v msg.prevLogIndex
  /-- Entries from leader: new entries written beyond `prevLogIndex` come from the
      leader's log.  Captures that the leader only sends its own log entries. -/
  hcand_eq : ∀ k, k > msg.prevLogIndex →
      applyAppendEntries E (cs.logs v) msg k = cs.logs lead k
  /-- No rollback of committed entries: voter `v`'s committed index is at most
      `prevLogIndex`.  This is the Rust panic guard in `maybe_append`:
      `if conflict != 0 && conflict <= self.committed { panic!(...) }`. -/
  h_committed_le_prev : cs.committed v ≤ msg.prevLogIndex
  /-- Committed indices only advance (monotone) across the step. -/
  hcommitted_mono : ∀ w, cs'.committed w ≥ cs.committed w
  /-- Newly committed entries are quorum-certified in the new state.
      This is the formal expression of the Raft commit rule (§5.3): a leader
      only advances `leaderCommit` after receiving quorum ACKs.
      `CommitRule.lean` CR8 shows `CommitRuleValid` is definitionally equal to this. -/
  hnew_cert : ∀ w k e, cs'.committed w ≥ k → cs.committed w < k →
      cs'.logs w k = some e →
      isQuorumCommitted cs'.voters cs'.logs k e
  /-- Quorum-certified entries in the old state remain quorum-certified in the new state.
      This is the formal consequence of leader completeness + AE broadcast: before sending AE,
      the leader has all quorum-certified entries; it only appends entries from its own log;
      so quorum certification is preserved after the step.
      `LeaderCompleteness.lean` LC3 + `hasQuorum_monotone` discharges this condition
      when `CandidateLogCovers` holds (see `validAEStep_hqc_preserved_from_lc`, CPS13). -/
  hqc_preserved : ∀ k e, isQuorumCommitted cs.voters cs.logs k e →
      isQuorumCommitted cs'.voters cs'.logs k e

/-! ## CPS1: No overwrite of committed entries -/

/-- **CPS1** — A valid AE step does not overwrite voter `v`'s committed entries.

    **Proof**: voter `v`'s committed index `≤ prevLogIndex` (by `h_committed_le_prev`).
    For any `k ≤ committed_v ≤ prevLogIndex`, `CT2` (`applyAE_preserves_prefix`) gives
    `applyAppendEntries (logs v) msg k = logs v k`.
    Since `cs'.logs v = applyAppendEntries ... k` (by `hlogs'_v`), the result follows.

    **Significance**: this discharges the `hno_overwrite` condition in `RaftReachable.step`
    from a concrete protocol condition (`h_committed_le_prev`), which corresponds to the
    Rust panic guard in `maybe_append` (`conflict ≤ committed → fatal!`). -/
theorem validAEStep_hno_overwrite (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') :
    ∀ k, cs.committed v ≥ k → cs'.logs v k = cs.logs v k := by

  have hle : k ≤ msg.prevLogIndex := Nat.le_trans hk hstep.h_committed_le_prev
  rw [congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v k]
  exact applyAE_preserves_prefix E (cs.logs v) msg k hle

/-! ## CPS8, CPS9: Log access helpers -/

/-- **CPS8** — Voter `v`'s log in the new state is the AE-updated log. -/
theorem validAEStep_logs_v (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') (k : Nat) :
    cs'.logs v k = applyAppendEntries E (cs.logs v) msg k :=
  congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v k

/-- **CPS9** — Other voters' logs are unchanged by the step. -/
theorem validAEStep_logs_other (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') (w : Nat) (hw : w ≠ v) (k : Nat) :
    cs'.logs w k = cs.logs w k :=
  congrFun (hstep.hlogs'_other w hw) k

/-! ## CPS4: Prefix unchanged -/

/-- **CPS4** — Indices ≤ `prevLogIndex` in voter `v`'s log are unchanged.

    This follows directly from CT2 (`applyAE_preserves_prefix`): `applyAppendEntries`
    does not modify entries at indices ≤ `prevLogIndex`.

    **Connection to Raft semantics**: the AppendEntries protocol only writes NEW entries
    after `prevLogIndex`; the prefix (representing the stable log up to the match point)
    is explicitly preserved. -/
theorem validAEStep_prefix_unchanged (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') (k : Nat) (hk : k ≤ msg.prevLogIndex) :
    cs'.logs v k = cs.logs v k := by
  rw [congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v k]
  exact applyAE_preserves_prefix E (cs.logs v) msg k hk

/-! ## CPS7: New entries at target indices -/

/-- **CPS7** — After the step, voter `v`'s log at index `k > prevLogIndex` matches
    the leader's log at `k`.

    This is a direct corollary of `hcand_eq` (the concrete AE precondition that new
    entries come from the leader's log) combined with `hlogs'_v`.

    Note: a more fine-grained version that talks about individual entries from
    `msg.entries` at specific offsets would require exposing the private `listGet?`
    helper from `ConcreteTransitions.lean`.  The present statement is sufficient for
    most downstream reasoning. -/
theorem validAEStep_new_entry_at (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') (k : Nat) (hk : k > msg.prevLogIndex) :
    cs'.logs v k = cs.logs lead k := by
  rw [congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v k]
  exact hstep.hcand_eq k hk

/-! ## CPS3: Entry from hcand_eq matches leader's log -/

/-- **CPS3** — An entry written by the AE step at index `k > prevLogIndex` equals the
    leader's log at `k`.

    **Proof**: `hcand_eq` directly gives `applyAppendEntries (logs v) msg k = cs.logs lead k`.
    The result is `cs'.logs v k = cs.logs lead k`.

    **Significance**: this confirms that after the step, voter `v`'s log at new positions
    agrees with the leader's log — the fundamental correctness condition for AppendEntries. -/
theorem validAEStep_hcand_eq_at_entry (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs') (k : Nat) (hk : k > msg.prevLogIndex) :
    cs'.logs v k = cs.logs lead k := by
  rw [congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v k]
  exact hstep.hcand_eq k hk

/-! ## CPS5: LogMatchingInvariantFor preserved -/

/-- **CPS5** — A valid AE step preserves `LogMatchingInvariantFor`.

    **Proof**: apply CT4 (`lmi_preserved_single_step`).  The updated log family in the
    new cluster state matches the updated-log hypothesis of CT4 because:
    - Voter `v`'s log = `applyAppendEntries ... msg` (by `hlogs'_v`)
    - Other voters' logs are unchanged (by `hlogs'_other`)

    **Significance**: if `LogMatchingInvariantFor` held in the old state (all voter pairs
    have consistent logs), it holds in the new state.  This is the inductive step for
    log matching, which in turn enables `CandLogMatching` and ultimately
    `HLogConsistency` (via CT5b / CPS6).

    **Note**: The `hlmi` and `hclm` hypotheses — log matching invariant and cand-log
    matching — are abstract invariants that must be maintained by the full protocol.
    `CPS6` shows `hclm` is sufficient for `HLogConsistency`. -/
theorem validAEStep_lmi_preserved (E : Type) [DecidableEq E] {cs cs' : ClusterState E}
    {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}
    (hstep : ValidAEStep E cs lead v msg cs')
    (hlmi : LogMatchingInvariantFor E cs.logs)
    (hclm : CandLogMatching E cs.logs (cs.logs lead)) :
    LogMatchingInvariantFor E cs'.logs := by
  -- Apply CT4 to the AE-updated log family (no .symm needed: hprev has correct direction)
  have hct4 := lmi_preserved_single_step E cs.logs (cs.logs lead) msg v
      hlmi hclm hstep.hprev hstep.hcand_eq
  -- cs'.logs agrees pointwise with the CT4 result function
  have heq : cs'.logs = fun w i => if w = v then applyAppendEntries E (cs.logs v) msg i
      else cs.logs w i := by
    funext w i
    by_cases hw : w = v
    · subst hw
      rw [if_pos rfl]
      exact congrFun hstep.hlogs'_v i
    · simp only [if_neg hw]; exact congrFun (hstep.hlogs'_other w hw) i
  rw [heq]
  exact hct4

/-! ## CPS6: HLogConsistency from CandLogMatching (CT5b) -/

/-- **CPS6** — If `CandLogMatching` holds for the leader's log in the new state,
    then `HLogConsistency` holds for the candidate (leader) log after the step.

    **Proof**: direct application of CT5b (`hlc_from_hae`) from `ConcreteTransitions.lean`.

    **Significance**: once `CandLogMatching` is established (which CT4b/CPS5 preserves
    inductively), `HLogConsistency` follows for free.  This closes the A4 gap:
    `HLogConsistency` → `CandidateLogCovers` → `leaderCompleteness` (LC3/LC8).

    The remaining A5 gap is establishing the *initial* `CandLogMatching` at the start
    of each leader's term (when the leader first sends AE). -/
theorem validAEStep_hlc (E : Type) {cs' : ClusterState E}
    (voterLog : Nat → LogId)
    (candLastTerm candLastIndex : Nat → Nat)
    (hae : ∀ w k, k ≤ (voterLog w).index → cs'.logs w k = cs'.logs cs'.voters.head! k) :
    HLogConsistency E voterLog cs'.logs candLastTerm candLastIndex
        (cs'.logs cs'.voters.head!) :=
  hlc_from_hae E voterLog cs'.logs candLastTerm candLastIndex
      (cs'.logs cs'.voters.head!) hae

/-! ## CPS2: Main theorem — ValidAEStep → RaftReachable -/

/-- **CPS2 — The main theorem**: a valid AppendEntries step on a `RaftReachable` cluster
    state produces a new `RaftReachable` cluster state.

    **Proof**: apply `RaftReachable.step` directly.  The five hypotheses required are:
    - `hlogs'`: from `hlogs'_other` in `ValidAEStep`
    - `hno_overwrite`: `validAEStep_hno_overwrite` (CPS1) — uses `h_committed_le_prev` + CT2
    - `hqc_preserved`: from `hqc_preserved` in `ValidAEStep`
    - `hcommitted_mono`: from `hcommitted_mono` in `ValidAEStep`
    - `hnew_cert`: from `hnew_cert` in `ValidAEStep`

    **Significance**: this is the **A5 bridge theorem**.  It connects the abstract
    `RaftReachable` inductive definition to a concrete AppendEntries protocol step.
    The three remaining abstract fields (`hqc_preserved`, `hcommitted_mono`, `hnew_cert`)
    are the precise obligations that must be discharged from the full election and
    term-management model to obtain an unconditional safety proof. -/

    {cs cs' : ClusterState E} {lead v : Nat} {msg : AppendEntriesMsg E}

    hstep.hcommitted_mono
    hstep.hnew_cert

/-! ## CPS10: Two consecutive steps -/

/-- **CPS10** — Two consecutive valid AE steps both preserve `RaftReachable`.

    If `cs → cs₁ → cs₂` with two valid AE steps, and `cs` is reachable, then `cs₂` is
    reachable.  This is the base case for inductive reasoning about AE broadcast sequences.

    **Proof**: apply `validAEStep_raftReachable` twice. -/
theorem twoStep_raftReachable (E : Type) [DecidableEq E]
    {cs cs₁ cs₂ : ClusterState E}
    {lead₁ v₁ : Nat} {msg₁ : AppendEntriesMsg E}

  validAEStep_raftReachable E
    (validAEStep_raftReachable E hreach hstep₁)
    hstep₂

/-! ## CPS11: Committed indices of non-v voters unchanged -/

/-- **CPS11** — If only voter `v`'s committed index changes in the step
    (non-`v` voters have the same committed index in old and new state), then
    `hcommitted_mono` follows from this local monotonicity condition.

    A useful specialisation when the step only updates voter `v`.

    **Proof**: case split on `w = v`. -/

    (hother_eq : ∀ w, w ≠ v → cs'.committed w = cs.committed w)
    (hnew_cert : ∀ w k e, cs'.committed w ≥ k → cs.committed w < k →

    · exact hw ▸ hv_mono
    · exact Nat.le_of_eq (hother_eq w hw).symm
  hnew_cert := hnew_cert
  hqc_preserved := hqc_preserved

/-! ## CPS12: No committed-entry rollback across the step -/

/-- **CPS12** — For ALL voters, committed entries are preserved across a valid AE step.

    For voter `v`: follows from CPS1 (`validAEStep_hno_overwrite`) since
    `committed v ≤ prevLogIndex` and AE preserves the prefix.

    For voter `w ≠ v`: follows from `hlogs'_other` since their logs are unchanged.

    **Significance**: this is a global no-rollback theorem — no voter ever loses a
    committed entry.  It generalises `hno_overwrite` (which is for voter `v` only) to
    the entire cluster. -/

/-! ## CPS11: Non-v committed indices -/

/-- **CPS11** — The committed index of voters other than `v` is unchanged in a step where
    only voter `v`'s log was updated and committed was not changed for others.

    This formalises the observation that AppendEntries only updates the target follower;
    the committed index of other voters changes only when they receive their own AE
    or when the leader broadcasts new commit information.

    **Note**: this is a structural lemma for building `ValidAEStep` in concrete proofs.
    It extracts the consequence of `hcommitted_mono` for the non-`v` voters. -/

/-! ## CPS13: Discharge hqc_preserved from CandidateLogCovers -/

/-- **CPS13** — Given leader completeness (`CandidateLogCovers`), the `hqc_preserved`
    condition of `ValidAEStep` is automatically satisfied.

    **Statement**: if the leader has all quorum-committed entries (`CandidateLogCovers`)
    and `hstep` is a `ValidAEStep`, then any quorum-committed entry in the old cluster
    state is still quorum-committed in the new state.

    **Proof**:
    1. By `leaderCompleteness` (LC3), the leader has `e` at `k` (`cs.logs lead k = some e`).
    2. For each voter `w`:
       - If `w ≠ v`: their log is unchanged (`hlogs'_other`), so `cs'.logs w k = cs.logs w k`.
       - If `w = v` and `k ≤ prevLogIndex`: the prefix is unchanged (`validAEStep_prefix_unchanged`).
       - If `w = v` and `k > prevLogIndex`: `cs'.logs v k = cs.logs lead k = some e` (`hcand_eq`).
    3. In all cases, wherever `cs.logs w k = some e`, so does `cs'.logs w k = some e`.
    4. By `hasQuorum_monotone`, `isQuorumCommitted cs'.voters cs'.logs k e` follows.

    **Significance**: this theorem closes the `hqc_preserved` gap in `ValidAEStep`.
    Combined with `validAEStep_raftReachable`, it means: if the leader satisfies
    `CandidateLogCovers` and the step satisfies the other `ValidAEStep` conditions,
    the step preserves `RaftReachable`.

    **Remaining gap**: `CandidateLogCovers` itself requires `HLogConsistency` (LC7),
    which in turn needs the full log-matching invariant from a concrete protocol model.
    However, this theorem reduces the abstract `hqc_preserved` obligation to the
    concrete `CandidateLogCovers` predicate, which is closer to the protocol level. -/
