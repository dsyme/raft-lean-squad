# Progress — Lean 4 Specification

Formal specification of the `Progress` replication tracker from
`src/tracker/progress.rs` and `src/tracker/state.rs`.

`Progress` is the Raft leader's per-follower view of the replication pipeline.
It is a three-state machine (`Probe`, `Replicate`, `Snapshot`) with two key
index fields: `matched` (highest acknowledged index) and `next_idx` (next to
send).

## Model scope and approximations

* **`Inflights` omitted**: The `ins` field (in-flight message tracker, a ring
  buffer) is omitted. `is_paused` in Replicate state is approximated as always
  `false`. Future runs can compose `Inflights.lean` with this model.
* **`committed_index` omitted**: Orthogonal to the core state machine.
* **`pending_request_snapshot` omitted**: Secondary path; omitted.
  `maybeDecrTo` models the simple `request_snapshot = INVALID_INDEX` case.
* **`u64` indices**: modelled as `Nat` (unbounded).
* **Logging/panics**: `update_state` panics in Snapshot state; omitted.
* **`resume()`**: sets `paused = false`; inlined.

namespace FVSquad.Progress

/-! ## State machine -/

/-- The three replication modes from `src/tracker/state.rs`. -/
inductive ProgressState where
  | Probe     -- probing: one message per heartbeat, then pause
  | Replicate -- fast-path: pipeline entries up to in-flight cap
  | Snapshot  -- snapshot in flight: all replication paused
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, BEq

/-! ## Data model -/

/-- Lean model of `Progress`. Fields not relevant to the core state machine
    (`committed_index`, `pending_request_snapshot`, `ins`) are omitted. -/
structure Progress where
  matched          : Nat            -- highest confirmed log index
  next_idx         : Nat            -- next log index to send (> matched)
  state            : ProgressState
  paused           : Bool
  pending_snapshot : Nat            -- snapshot index (Snapshot state only)
  recent_active    : Bool
  deriving Repr

/-! ## Representation invariant -/

/-- **INV-1 (index ordering)**: the next index to send is always strictly
    beyond the last acknowledged index. -/
def valid (p : Progress) : Prop :=
  p.matched + 1 ≤ p.next_idx

/-! ## Helper -/

/-- Internal `reset_state`: set state, clear `paused` and `pending_snapshot`. -/
private def resetState (p : Progress) (s : ProgressState) : Progress :=
  { p with state := s, paused := false, pending_snapshot := 0 }

/-! ## Operations -/

/-- **`maybe_update(n)`**: process an acknowledgement of entries up to index
    `n`. Returns `(updated_progress, did_update)`.

    If `n > matched`, sets `matched := n` (and resumes), advances `next_idx`.
    Otherwise just advances `next_idx` if needed (stale ack). -/
def maybeUpdate (p : Progress) (n : Nat) : Progress × Bool :=
  if p.matched < n then
    ({ p with matched := n, paused := false,
              next_idx := Nat.max p.next_idx (n + 1) }, true)
  else
    ({ p with next_idx := Nat.max p.next_idx (n + 1) }, false)

/-- **`become_probe()`**: transition to Probe state. -/
def becomeProbe (p : Progress) : Progress :=
  let base := resetState p .Probe
  match p.state with
  | .Snapshot => { base with next_idx := Nat.max (p.matched + 1) (p.pending_snapshot + 1) }
  | _         => { base with next_idx := p.matched + 1 }

/-- **`become_replicate()`**: transition to Replicate state. -/
def becomeReplicate (p : Progress) : Progress :=
  { resetState p .Replicate with next_idx := p.matched + 1 }

/-- **`become_snapshot(snapshot_idx)`**: transition to Snapshot state. -/
def becomeSnapshot (p : Progress) (snapIdx : Nat) : Progress :=
  { resetState p .Snapshot with pending_snapshot := snapIdx }

/-- **`optimistic_update(n)`**: advance `next_idx` in Replicate mode without
    waiting for an ack. -/
def optimisticUpdate (p : Progress) (n : Nat) : Progress :=
  { p with next_idx := n + 1 }

/-- **`maybe_decr_to(rejected, match_hint)`**: process a log rejection.
    Simplified model: ignores the `request_snapshot` path
    (models the `request_snapshot = INVALID_INDEX` case). -/
def maybeDecrTo (p : Progress) (rejected : Nat) (matchHint : Nat) : Progress × Bool :=
  match p.state with
  | .Replicate =>
      if rejected ≤ p.matched then
        (p, false)     -- stale rejection
      else
        ({ p with next_idx := p.matched + 1 }, true)  -- roll back
  | _ =>
      -- stale if "rejected" doesn't correspond to what we last sent
      if p.next_idx = 0 ∨ p.next_idx - 1 ≠ rejected then
        (p, false)
      else
        let nextClamped := Nat.max (Nat.min rejected (matchHint + 1)) (p.matched + 1)
        ({ p with next_idx := nextClamped, paused := false }, true)

/-- **`is_paused()`**: is replication currently paused?
    Replicate state is never paused in this model (Inflights omitted). -/
def isPaused (p : Progress) : Bool :=
  match p.state with
  | .Probe     => p.paused
  | .Replicate => false   -- abstraction: ignores Inflights.full()
  | .Snapshot  => true
