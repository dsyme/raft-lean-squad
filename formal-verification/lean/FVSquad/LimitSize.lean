# LimitSize — Lean 4 Specification and Implementation Model

Formal specification and implementation model of `limit_size` from `src/util.rs`.
This utility truncates a list of log entries to the longest prefix whose total
serialised byte-size fits within a given budget, subject to a minimum-one guarantee.

## Model scope and approximations

* **Type abstraction**: each log entry is modelled as a single `Nat` representing its
  serialised byte size (`T.compute_size()`). The entry payload is abstracted away.
* **`Option Nat` limit**: the Rust function takes `Option<u64>` where `None` and
  `Some(NO_LIMIT = u64::MAX)` both mean "unlimited". In this model, `None` means
  unlimited. The `u64::MAX` sentinel is not modelled.
* **Pure function**: the Rust function mutates in place; the Lean model is a pure
  function returning the truncated list.
* **`u64` overflow**: the Rust `size` accumulator is `u64`; this model uses unbounded
  `Nat` and does not model overflow.
* **Zero-size entries**: the Rust algorithm accepts all entries whose
  `compute_size() == 0` unconditionally (because the `size == 0` check remains true
  until the first nonzero-sized entry is encountered). This model faithfully captures
  that behaviour.
* **Omitted**: `NO_LIMIT` sentinel, `u64` overflow, in-place mutation, Protobuf
  serialisation cost, error handling.

/-! ## Types -/

/-- `SizeList` models a vector of log entries abstracted to their byte sizes. -/
abbrev SizeList := List Nat

/-! ## Implementation model

The Rust algorithm (paraphrased):

```rust
let mut size: u64 = 0;
count = iter.take_while(|e| {
    if size == 0 { size += e.compute_size(); return true }  // first real entry: always accept
    size += e.compute_size();
    size <= max
}).count();
```

The `size == 0` guard means: accept the entry unconditionally while the running total
is still zero (i.e., while all previous entries had size 0 or this is the first entry).
Once the running total becomes nonzero, subsequent entries are accepted only if the new
cumulative total is ≤ `max`.

Lean model: use `acc` (running total) and `count` (number accepted so far).
Accept an entry iff `acc = 0 ∨ acc + x ≤ lim`.
-/

/-- Core accumulator: scan `rest` starting from running total `acc` and count `count`.
    Returns the total number of entries to keep.

    Accepts entry `x` iff `acc = 0` (running total not yet positive, i.e.\ all prior
    entries had size 0) or `acc + x ≤ lim` (budget not exceeded). -/
def limitSizeGo (lim acc count : Nat) : SizeList → Nat
  | []      => count
  | x :: xs =>
    if acc = 0 ∨ acc + x ≤ lim
    then limitSizeGo lim (acc + x) (count + 1) xs
    else count

/-- `limitSizeCount lim sizes` returns the number of entries to retain. -/
def limitSizeCount (lim : Nat) (sizes : SizeList) : Nat :=
  limitSizeGo lim 0 0 sizes

/-- `limitSize sizes limit` truncates `sizes` to the first `limitSizeCount lim sizes`
    entries.  Returns `sizes` unchanged when `limit = none`. -/
def limitSize (sizes : SizeList) (limit : Option Nat) : SizeList :=
  match limit with
  | none      => sizes
  | some lim  => sizes.take (limitSizeCount lim sizes)

/-! ## Sanity checks via `#eval` and `decide` -/

/-- `limitSize` always keeps at least one entry when the input is non-empty. -/

      omega

/-! ### T3: Sum ≤ limit when more than one entry is kept (and first entry is nonzero) -/

/-- **Budget safety**: when the result has more than one entry and the first entry has
    positive size (the typical case for Raft log entries), the total byte size of the
    result is within the budget.

    **Proof strategy**: induction on `limitSizeGo` with the invariant that once `acc > 0`,
    we only accept entries that keep `acc ≤ lim`. The first entry is accepted via the
    `acc = 0` branch; once it is accepted (setting `acc = first.size > 0`), subsequent
    entries satisfy `acc + x ≤ lim` at acceptance, so the running total ≤ lim.

    **Corner case**: if `sizes[0] = 0` (zero-size first entry), acc stays 0 longer and
    more entries may be accepted unconditionally. This theorem requires `sizes[0] > 0`. -/

/-! ### T4: Maximality — adding one more entry would exceed the budget -/

/-- **Maximality**: if `limitSize` truncated the input (output strictly shorter), then
    including the next entry would exceed the budget.

    **Proof strategy**: when `limitSizeGo` stops (returns `count` without incrementing),
    the condition `acc = 0 ∨ acc + x ≤ lim` was false, meaning `acc > 0` and `acc + x > lim`.
    Since `acc ≤ lim` at that point (by the budget invariant), the result sum + next entry
    size exceeds `lim`. -/
