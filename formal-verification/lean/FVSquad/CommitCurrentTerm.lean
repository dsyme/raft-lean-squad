# CommitToCurrentTerm — Lean 4 Specification, Implementation, and Proofs

Formal specification of `RaftCore::commit_to_current_term` and
`RaftCore::apply_to_current_term` from `src/raft.rs` (lines 590–601).

Both are pure Boolean predicates checking whether the committed (or applied)
log index was written in the **current Raft term**. They serve as liveness gates:

- `commit_to_current_term` guards `MsgReadIndex`: a leader must have committed
  an entry from its own term before serving linearisable reads (Raft thesis §6.4).
- `apply_to_current_term` gates `check_group_commit_consistent`.

## Relevant Rust code

```rust
pub fn commit_to_current_term(&self) -> bool {
    self.raft_log.term(self.raft_log.committed).is_ok_and(|t| t == self.term)
}

pub fn apply_to_current_term(&self) -> bool {
    self.raft_log.term(self.raft_log.applied).is_ok_and(|t| t == self.term)
}
```

`RaftLog::term(idx)` returns `Ok(t)` for `t = logTerm(idx)` when the index is
in range, or `Ok(0)` for out-of-range indices (sentinel). `is_ok_and(|t| t == term)`
maps `Ok(t)` → `t == term` and anything else → `false`. In our Lean model we use
`Option Nat` with `some t` / `none` instead of `Result<u64, Error>` with `is_ok_and`.

## Model scope and approximations

- **`RaftState`**: the relevant slice of `RaftCore` is modelled as a structure with
  four fields: `term`, `committed`, `applied`, and `logTerm` (the combined term lookup).
- **`logTerm`**: models `raft_log.term(idx)` as `Nat → Option Nat`.
  - `some t` corresponds to `Ok(t)` (index in range, term available).
  - `none` corresponds to `Err(Compacted)` / `Err(Unavailable)`.
  - The out-of-range sentinel `Ok(0)` is captured by `logTerm` returning `some 0`
    for out-of-range indices (same as `RaftLogTerm.lean` convention).
- **`is_ok_and`**: modelled as Option-equality: `logTerm idx == some term`.
- **`applied ≤ committed`** is an explicit well-formedness assumption (`wf`); the Lean
  theorems that depend on it state it explicitly.
- **No mutation, I/O, errors, or logging** are modelled.
- **`term ≠ 0`** is a Raft invariant assumed in several theorems (initial term is 0
  but is incremented before any entry is written or these predicates matter).

## Theorems proved (no `sorry`)

Characterisations (P1–P4):
  1. `commitToCurrentTerm_true_iff`  — `true ↔ logTerm(committed) = some term`
  2. `commitToCurrentTerm_false_iff` — `false ↔ logTerm(committed) ≠ some term`
  3. `applyToCurrentTerm_true_iff`   — `true ↔ logTerm(applied) = some term`
  4. `applyToCurrentTerm_false_iff`  — `false ↔ logTerm(applied) ≠ some term`

Consequence theorems (P5–P8):
  5. `notCommit_logTerm_ne`   — ¬commit → logTerm(committed) ≠ some term
  6. `notApply_logTerm_ne`    — ¬apply → logTerm(applied) ≠ some term
  7. `commit_logTerm_eq`      — commit → logTerm(committed) = some term
  8. `apply_logTerm_eq`       — apply → logTerm(applied) = some term

Independence / witness (P9–P10):
  9. `commit_witness`  — ∃ state where commitToCurrentTerm = true
  10. `apply_witness`  — ∃ state where applyToCurrentTerm = true

Implication under invariants (P11–P13):
  11. `applyImpliesCommit` — (applied ≤ committed ∧ log monotone ∧ term bounded)
                              → applyToCurrentTerm → commitToCurrentTerm
  12. `commit_implies_term_nonzero` — commitToCurrentTerm ∧ logTerm(committed) ≠ some 0
                                       → term ≠ 0
  13. `apply_implies_term_nonzero`  — applyToCurrentTerm ∧ logTerm(applied) ≠ some 0
                                       → term ≠ 0

Independence of the two predicates (P14–P16):
  14. `commit_not_implies_apply` — commitToCurrentTerm does NOT imply applyToCurrentTerm
                                   (there exists a state where commit holds but apply doesn't)
  15. `commit_eq_apply_when_committed_eq_applied` — if committed = applied, then
      commitToCurrentTerm = applyToCurrentTerm
  16. `apply_eq_commit_when_same_idx` — committed = applied → (apply ↔ commit)

Decidability coverage (P17):
  17. `coverage_decide` — decide: all 3-element finite combinations handled correctly

/-! ## Abstract model -/

/-- Abstract model of the Raft state relevant to the two predicates.

    Fields:
    - `term`      — current Raft term (`self.term`).
    - `committed` — committed log index (`self.raft_log.committed`).
    - `applied`   — applied log index (`self.raft_log.applied`).
    - `logTerm`   — abstract term lookup: `Nat → Option Nat`.
      Corresponds to `raft_log.term(idx)`:
      `some t` = `Ok(t)` (term available),
      `none`   = `Err(Compacted)` / `Err(Unavailable)`. -/

    Formalises: a leader only appends entries in its own term, and followers
    reject entries with term > self.term. -/

    **Proof sketch**:
    - `applyToCurrentTerm s = true` gives `s.logTerm s.applied = some s.term`.
    - Since `s.applied ≤ s.committed`, by log monotonicity we get some `tj` with
      `s.logTerm s.committed = some tj` and `s.term ≤ tj`.
    - By term boundedness: `tj ≤ s.term`.
    - Therefore `tj = s.term`, giving `s.logTerm s.committed = some s.term`. -/
