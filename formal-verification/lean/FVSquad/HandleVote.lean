# HandleVote — Lean 4 Specification and Implementation (Phase 3 + 4)

Models the `MsgRequestVote | MsgRequestPreVote` arm of `RaftCore::step()` in
`src/raft.rs` (lines ≈ 1485–1530).

## Relevant Rust code

```rust
MessageType::MsgRequestVote | MessageType::MsgRequestPreVote => {
    let can_vote = (self.vote == m.from)
        || (self.vote == INVALID_ID && self.leader_id == INVALID_ID)
        || (m.get_msg_type() == MessageType::MsgRequestPreVote && m.term > self.term);
    if can_vote
        && self.raft_log.is_up_to_date(m.index, m.log_term)
        && (m.index > self.raft_log.last_index() || self.priority <= get_priority(&m))
    {
        let mut to_send = new_message(m.from, vote_resp_msg_type, None);
        to_send.term = m.term;
        to_send.reject = false;
        if m.get_msg_type() == MessageType::MsgRequestVote {
            self.vote = m.from;
            self.election_elapsed = 0;
        }
        self.msgs.push(to_send);
    } else {
        let mut to_send = new_message(m.from, vote_resp_msg_type, None);
        to_send.term = self.term;
        to_send.reject = true;
        to_send.commit = self.raft_log.committed;
        // commit_term set...
        self.msgs.push(to_send);
        self.maybe_commit_by_vote(&m);
    }
}
```

## Model scope and approximations

* `NodeId`, `Term`, log indices modelled as `Nat`.
* `Int` models Rust's `i64`; `Nat` models `u64`.
* `INVALID_ID = 0` (same convention as `FVSquad.VoteCommitment`).
* `get_priority` is abstracted: `VoteRequest.priority : Int` is the pre-computed
  result of `get_priority(&m)`.
* `maybe_commit_by_vote` is **omitted** — this file models only the vote response.
* The leader-lease early-return guard (before this arm) is **not modelled** —
  the handler is assumed to be reached unconditionally.
* I/O, message queuing, network, persistence are all omitted.
* Log contents are abstracted to `(last_log_term, last_log_index)`.
* The `check_quorum` flag and lease timing are not modelled.

See `FVSquad.VoteCommitment` for the simpler at-most-one-vote safety invariant;
this file extends that with the full three-condition decision and pre-vote semantics.

    priority is at least as high as the voter's priority. -/

/-- `handleVote`: pure model of the vote handler.

    Grant path (`shouldGrant = true`):
    * Response: `reject = false`, `resp_term = req.term`.
    * For a real vote: record `vote := req.from_` and reset `election_elapsed := 0`.
    * For a pre-vote: state is unchanged.
